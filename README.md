# Optimization Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the **Optimization Algorithms** repository! This is a collection of implementations for various optimization algorithms, designed for efficient storage, execution, and scalability without cluttering presentations. The repository is continuously updated as more algorithms are developed and added.

Main collaborators : Rafik YAHIA & Sidali BAHA (wanna join us? you're more than welcome)

## üìÇ **Current Contents**
- **GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure) for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**:
  - Implements a GRASP-based approach to solve the TSP efficiently.
  - Focuses on modularity and adaptability for future enhancements.

---

## üöÄ **Purpose**
- Store and execute optimization algorithms without embedding code in presentations.
- Provide a clean, centralized location for algorithm development.
- Ensure long-term scalability for additional implementations.

## ‚ö° **Usage**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RafikYH/optimization-algorithms.git
   cd optimization-algorithms

2. Navigate to the desired algorithm folder (e.g., grasp-tsp) and run the code
   ```bash
   python grasp_tsp.py
